How to Mocha
============

Ever wanted to write SUPER AWESOME javascript tests?

Let's get started!

* Install Node
  * `brew install node` on OSX
  * Use the node installer from the [Node website]() on windows
  * Google it for Linux instructions
* Fork this repository
* `cd` into the repository, and run `npm install`
* Run `npm test` to run tests (look in the package.json to see what this does!)
* Write more tests
* Write more code
* Repeat above two steps until happy
